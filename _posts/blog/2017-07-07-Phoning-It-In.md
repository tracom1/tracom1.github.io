I hate to tell you guys this, but I'm totally phoning in my blog post this week.  (I initially had this week in the previous sentence three times!)  I thought of a few ideas to write about, but turns out, I'm just too tired to write about them!  So next week look for some great researched information about Vault/Consul (I'm also planning on having my HA instance stood up by then too), or a discussion about resume management for maternity leave, breaks from tech, etc.  So at least you have something to look forward to!

In the meantime, please enjoy this youtube video from Jenn Schiffer, who is probably one of my favorite satirists in technology.  I feel like she really gets me, and makes being a woman in tech, just a little bit easier.  Her talk is about how satire being taken literally (because she's a woman) can really cause a world of trouble.  She also emphasizes how the response to people in the tech community, whether sincere or not, should be slightly more gentle.

Satire and laughter is an important component of tech, and one of the things that I really feel keeps me sane.  So here's to sanity ladies and gentlemen!
