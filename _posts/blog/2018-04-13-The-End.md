I've been toying with this idea for a while now, but I've finally made the decision to stop blogging about "Women in Tech".  When I first started this blog, I wanted to get my voice out there, and talk about things I felt were important to being a woman in tech.  I wanted to start conversations that weren't necessarily being heard, and I wanted to talk about tech.

I have spent a lot of time researching articles, following people on Twitter, reaching out and talking to individuals who are doing wonderful things about the Women in Tech movement.  I've spoken with a lot of men who are just as passionate about bringing women into tech.  It's been a fun ride.

Right now, I'm a woman on the sidelines of tech.  I don't work with it every day, and I don't really feel that I have anything to say about the current day-to-day lives of women in tech, or of the technology they work with.  So I've decided to stop blogging about women in tech.

If you have subscribed to this blog, I will automatically remove you from my subscription list.

I do have an idea for another blog, talking about the history of various technologies, which I probably kick off in a month or so while I do some redesign work on my website.  I'll be using the same domain for those posts.  If you're interested in being put on that subscription list (so you don't have to keep checking my webpage to see when I've decided to post), feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:tracy@techlady.ninja ?subject=New%20Blog%20Subscribe">tracy@techlady.ninja</a>.

Thanks for being on this journey with me.
