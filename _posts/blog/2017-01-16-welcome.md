I have slowly come to the realization that I am a woman in tech.

I fought it for a long time, mostly because I don’t feel I have enough “technical savvy” or “coding skills” to be truly classified as someone representative of an entire category.  But it’s been over 5 years now since I first started working in tech full-time, so I have to concede defeat.

I’m here.  You’re stuck with me.

When I first got my bachelor’s degree in Theology, I never imagined I would end up spending most of my day-to-day life in the command line.  It was a series of fortuitous events (<i>I have an uncanny knack for getting offered jobs</i>) that led me to a job as an automated tester in Java at NASDAQ, SAIC, and then Overstock, which led me to DevOps, Systems Engineering and most recently, learning about the cloud.  Along the way I have met a lot of different and interesting people and while I still believe I was destined to be rich and live a life of luxury, I enjoy where I am now.

The purpose of this blog will be multi-pronged: 
* Have an open forum to discuss technical "coolness" or "suckness" <i><b>(I'm looking at you Java GC)</b></i>
* Talk about the day-to-day of being a woman in tech
* Get feedback thoughts from others perspectives

I am hoping to have both women and men contribute with their perspectives from working in the field, and share some knowledge about what they know.

This blog/forum is supposed to be collaborative.  If anybody has a good idea for a post, please reach out to me!  I’d be happy to consider and post it on the site.  My technical knowledge and experiences are limited, so I want to get as many different perspectives on the site as possible.

One last thing: If you feel I or somebody else has promulgated tech "weirdness" or there is a better way to do something, do not be afraid to speak up.  Everybody has their own way of doing things, and this is as much a place to learn as it is a place for me to learn html.

I look forward to forming this community together.
