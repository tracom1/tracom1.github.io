&lt;p&gt;I fought it for a long time, mostly because I don’t feel I have enough “technical savvy” or “coding skills” to be truly classified as someone representative of an entire category.  But it’s been over 5 years now since I first started working in tech full-time, so I have to concede defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m here.  You’re stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first got my bachelor’s degree in Theology, I never imagined I would end up spending most of my day-to-day life in the command line.  It was a series of fortuitous events (&lt;i&gt;I have an uncanny knack for getting offered jobs&lt;/i&gt;) that led me to a job as an automated tester in Java at NASDAQ, SAIC, and then Overstock, which led me to DevOps, Systems Engineering and most recently, learning about the cloud.  Along the way I have met a lot of different and interesting people and while I still believe I was destined to be rich and live a life of luxury, I enjoy where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this blog will be multi-pronged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have an open forum to discuss technical “coolness” or “suckness” &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;(I’m looking at you Java GC)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about the day-to-day of being a woman in tech&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get feedback thoughts from others perspectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to have both women and men contribute with their perspectives from working in the field, and share some knowledge about what they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog/forum is supposed to be collaborative.  If anybody has a good idea for a post, please reach out to me!  I’d be happy to consider and post it on the site.  My technical knowledge and experiences are limited, so I want to get as many different perspectives on the site as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing: If you feel I or somebody else has promulgated tech “weirdness” or there is a better way to do something, do not be afraid to speak up.  Everybody has their own way of doing things, and this is as much a place to learn as it is a place for me to learn html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to forming this community together.&lt;/p&gt;
