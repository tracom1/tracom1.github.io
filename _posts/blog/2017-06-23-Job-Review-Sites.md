Today while I was listening to <i><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/dear_prudence.html">Slate's Dear Prudence</a></i> podcast, I learned that there's a job review site just for women!  How did I not know about this before?  The site is <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/">https://fairygodboss.com/</a>.

Based on my perusal, it looks like they are still building up their review base, but it definitely has some interesting components.  It talks about things like maternity leave.  Other women talk about growth potential, whether they believe women are treated fairly.  They also cover things like work-life balance, flexibility in the office (ability to work from home), and the community.

I like the site, but I'm not a huge fan of all the pop-ups.  I guess what I'm saying is their front-end could use some work.  They also don't have a whole lot of engineering reviews (so I recommend you go online and review your company!).  At least, I couldn't find any on a few large companies that I looked through.  One thing I did learn is that the culture at Square is pretty great for women -- so that's pretty cool.

Most of the time I've looked through company reviews, I've used <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com">https://www.glassdoor.com</a>.  I also use the webpage to see the latest reviews for my own company (newsflash: they aren't <i>the best</i>), which creates a constant debate about whether or not upper management places fake reviews.  Now, I'm not sure if that's the case, but there are an awful lot of 5 star reviews that have the same advice to management.  If this were one of my police procedurals, I would say "consistency in a statement is a sign of impropriety".

So keep in mind that sometimes people have ulterior motives for why they post things about a company.  Sometimes they are upset that they've been let go, sometimes they are being compensated for a good review, or sometimes they are just being honest about the situation.

Fairy Godboss doesn't seem like a place like Glassdoor though.  The women seem really interested in providing useful feedback and encouraging each other in their careers.  And that's a job/company review site that I can get on board with.
