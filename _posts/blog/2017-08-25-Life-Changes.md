Sometimes, life hands you changes.  Sometimes you are the instigator of those changes, and sometimes the changes are beyond your control.

A while ago, my husband and I decided that we wanted to try living abroad, and spent some time looking at other job opportunities.  Ultimately, we got a few different options, and decided to settle on moving to Berlin, Germany.  We were both pretty excited about it, though change can also be a bit daunting.

I had been trying to figure out what to do with myself.  I had turned down two job offers back in June, but my circumstances changed a bit and I thought that I would probably go crazy if I wasn't working full time -- even though both the jobs I had been offered were slightly daunting to me.  They both had a tech stack I was unfamiliar with, and they both leveraged AWS over something like Openstack, so I knew there would be a learning curve.

But I decided to dive in headfirst.  And now I have a new job!  I start in a few weeks.  I'm still pretty nervous, but I think it will be good.

It can be difficult to embrace change.  Sometimes it is so much easier to stay in a place where we know the people, and we know the technology.  It is comfortable there.  We know what we are doing, and we feel helpful.  I know I have been guilty of that in the past.  Plus, sometimes you just really enjoy the place where you are in life.

But sometimes your life needs a little shake up.  And when I do things, I apparently go BIG.

 and it will definitely take some time to get used to a new tech stack, but these are experiences that will help me grow, and hopefully make me a better technician.  I've been incredibly fortunate (or it's been ridiculously unusual), that I have not yet worked with AWS on a scale bigger than creating my own EC2 instance.

So I'll be in a new city, in a new country, at a new job, learning a new tech stack.  And it will definitely take some time to get used to the new tech stack.  But these are experience that will help me grow, and also make me a better technician.  I've never even worked with AWS before, which makes me either incredibly fortunate, or ridiculously unusual.  My current exposure to AWS is creating my own EC2 instance, so I am sure I will be spending a lot of time with the documentation (or talking to friends).

I'm optimistic that my current skill set will aide me in this new journey, but I know it's going to be a difficult few months, with a lot of Googling.  Although let's be honest, that is most of a technologist's life anyway.
